# What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

## $\color{gray}{Protocol\ Stack:}$

A protocol stack is a group of protocols that all work together to allow software or hardware to perform a function.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Layer\ 1:}$** **$\color{Orange}{Link\ Layer}$** - At the bottom layer, two computing devices need a physical mechanism to send digital data to each other. They send electromagnetic signals either over a wired or wireless connection and interpret the signal as bits. The type of physical connection affects the bit rate and bandwidth.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Layer\ 2:}$** **$\color{Orange}{Network\ Layer}$** - Once a network is bigger than two computers, we need addressing protocols to uniquely identify who is sending data and who should receive the data. Every node on the Internet is identified with an IP address.

The **network layer** is the heart of the **_Internet protocol stack_**. It basically hosts two different versions of the IP protocol, and the ICMP control message protocol. The basic service provided at this level is best-effort global delivery of datagrams.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Layer\ 3:}$** **$\color{Orange}{Transport\ Layer}$** - As the communication service provided by IP in the network layer is host-to-host only and unreliability, the transport layer provide communication services that add message integrity checks, process-to-process communication and the option to get reliable communication. The two basic services in the transport layer are **TCP** and **UDP**, but there are also other lesser known protocols at this level.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Layer\ 4:}$** **$\color{Orange}{Application\ Layer}$** - Finally, at the top of the stack are all the applications that exist out there. Applications mostly communicate with other processes at other hosts through one of the communication services provided by the transport layer but there are also a few applications that bypass the transport layer.

**_$\color{orange}{The\ journey\ of\ the\ user\ data\ from\ device\ A\ to\ device\ B\ begins\ as\ follows:}$_**

1. The user of device A(also called an initiator) uses the application on that device to ask the n-th layer protocol entity to transfer data to the application at the recipient side.

2. The n-th layer protocol entity adds its control information (PCI) to the data and passes the n-PDU message to the next layer down.

3. The (n-1)th layer entity executes a similar action…

4. Data that were generated by the application at the initiator side are thus passed down from one layer to the next lower layer, while each layer adds its own control information to the data.

5. When the data and control information added by all the layers reach the physical layer, it is all transferred through the physical channel to the recipient side.

6. On the recipient side, data flows up from one layer to the next higher layer. The protocol entity in each layer analyzes control information that was generated by its peer at the transmitting side. If everything goes well, the protocol entity passes user data it sees to the entity in the next higher layer.

7. This process is repeated until the data originally sent by the initiating application arrives at the application on the recipient side.
