## What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?

#### $\color{Pink}{What\ is\ web\ hosting?}$

The basic infrastructure that puts your website on the internet

Web hosting is a service that allows you to publish your website on the internet. It involves storing all your website files on a server and providing a way for people to access those files through a web browser. Think of it like renting a space on the internet.

#### $\color{Pink}{How\ does\ web\ hosting\ work?}$

In summary, companies rent out services and technologies to host your websites on the internet. Once you’ve chosen your domain name and signed up to a hosting plan, then your website is accessible on the internet.

When you use web hosting services, your web host is responsible for making sure your server is up and running. Not only that, but it is also a hosts job to prevent any security breaches and store all your files, assets and databases onto the server.

#### $\color{Pink}{What\ types\ of\ web\ hosting\ are\ there?}$

Most web hosts will offer different types of hosting and each will vary in cost. It all depends on your websites needs. We’ve compiled a list below to help you understand, which type of hosting is best suited to you.

**$\color{LightBlue} {Shared\ Hosting:}$**
Shared hosting is when a web hosting provider hosts a number of different websites on the same server. It is the most affordable form of hosting because you share the same server, so you split costs. If you are looking to start a blog or have a business that’s just starting up, then shared hosting is a good option.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Managed\ WordPress\ Hosting:}$**
WordPress Hosting simply means hosting that has been optimized for WordPress on a server level to ensure smooth sailing.

**_How is WordPress different from regular hosting?_** While details vary by provider, most WordPress hosting packages offer these common traits:

Simple one-click installation that avoids the dozen or so manual steps in configuring a new WordPress site.

Server configurations optimized for faster loading of WordPress sites. This could include performance cache optimizations and other tweaks.
Security measures to protect against common WordPress vulnerabilities. As WordPress powers over 30% of the web, it regularly comes under attack. You might also come across “Managed WordPress”, which often refers to a pre-defined secure environment that restricts usage of unsupported or vulnerable plugins.
WordPress hosting can run on a shared, VPS or dedicated servers.

**$\color{LightBlue}{VPS\ Hosting:}$**
VPS stands for Virtual Private Server. Like shared hosting, websites that run on VPS share a physical server with other websites. However, each VPS tenant has its own partition with guaranteed dedicated resources. There’s often more memory, storage and processing power available – with a price tag to match.

VPS hosting is recommended for highly experienced users with server management skills. VPS customers have root access to their partition and can configure their server software, for example Ubuntu, CentOS or Windows Server. This provides a high level of customization to run web apps built for those systems.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Dedicated\ Hosting:}$**
Dedicated hosting means you have the entire server to yourself. It gives you access like a VPS, but you don’t have to share the server with other sites or apps. Effectively, you are leasing a physical web server housed at your service provider’s facility. You also have professional support and expertise on hand when needed.

This top-end web hosting is only warranted for highly demanding enterprise-grade websites. Small and medium-sized businesses do not need to spend thousands each month to rent a dedicated web server for their business.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Cloud\ Hosting:}$**
These days, cloud hosting has become a bit of a nebulous term. So, we would strongly recommend looking closely at what you are getting if you are signing up for “Cloud Hosting”.

In the beginning, “cloud hosting” referred to a VPS setup scalable to multiple servers; this way, if your web application had a sudden traffic spike, the system would be able to provision more resources and keep things running smoothly. Cloud hosting would have a more variable pricing model and fluid specs as a result.

However, as the popularity of cloud computing has surged, some companies have started to co-op the term for their regular shared or VPS hosting. Other providers like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure offer cloud computing services, which usually include cloud hosting in an array of other advanced tools for cloud-based operations.

**$\color{LightBlue}{Reseller\ Hosting:}$** Reseller hosting makes it is possible for you to start your own hosting business and generate clients under your brand. In Reseller hosting, you employ the services of another parent web hosting company and utilize their resources to sell it as your own. It is an option that involves one hosting provider company that rents bandwidth and hard drive space, another mid-size business company, which then rents the space to third parties entrepreneurs and small businesses. In reseller hosting, you get a shared environment where you create multiple shared accounts under one master account.
